## Assignment Descriptions:
**Lesson** is created from existing Cengage textbook content. It is designed to promote chapter reading that introduces you to new skills and concepts, and it is normally due on Mondays. Other assignments listed below will be due later that same week. Each lesson is worth 2% of your grade. This assignment will take most of your time every week. Average is about 2 to 3 hours. (Plan 4 hours) NOTE: Due to Lessons not being 100% written for MAC computers, you will need to get at least 70% to get full credit (100%) for that activity. Any grade below that will receive a 0%.(Late penalties will be added to the 100% grade if applicable) 

**Extra Credit** are End-of-Module (EOM) projects that echo the language and pedagogy of textbook narrative activities. Most modules include 2 EOM projects, each covering approximately 50% of the gradable module objectives (more than 90% of module objectives between the 2 EOM projects). They take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete; the time will vary by student and number of steps of course. These projects are used as additional practice. (Plan 1 hour)

**Training** is an interactive training activity for each module. The first two trainings are each worth 3% of your total grade. It is also used as an assessment for the Tests Modules, each worth 6% of your grade.(Plan 1 hour)

**Project** measure students’ mastery of module learning objectives. Each project covers over 90% of the gradable module objectives. These projects will be the main resource to prepare you for the three semester Capstone Projects. Each project is worth 4% of your grade. SAM Projects take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. (Plan 2 hours) 

**Capstone** projects measure students’ mastery of learning objectives across multiple modules. Each Capstone project covers key skills across the full level (Introductory, Intermediate, or Advanced) of modules. They take approximately 50-75 minutes to complete; the time will vary by student and number of steps. SAM Capstone Projects are used as rigorous assessments for the Tests Modules, and each one is worth 6%.(Plan 2 hours)  

## Test Schedule:
Please check the Modules for Test 1 and Test 2 due dates!

Test 3:
* Capstone Project is due on the Wednesday of the Finals Week 11:55pm. 

## Late Submissions
**Prepare properly and help avoid panic and penalties**

I prefer not to accept any late submissions. Scheduling and submitting your work on time is extremely important in the workplace - you may loose your job if work is submitted late!

Now, I do understand that everyone has the occasional problem and finishes their work late. And for this course it is actually very important to complete your assignments [even late], because the next modules and especially the final student project always build on what you already have learned.

So here is my compromise going forward:

Make sure you know exactly when your assignments are due to be handed in and plan your work so that you can meet the submission deadlines. Consult your syllabus or ask in the module Discussion forums or send me a message via inbox if you are unsure of an assignment/assessment deadline and submission procedures.

Give yourself as much time as possible to complete each assignment so you can complete it to the best of your ability and you don't have to rush or worry about incurring late submission penalties. Avoid leaving completing an assignment to the last minute/hour/day just in case unexpected problems occur. I would highly suggest to have all your assignments done **at least one day prior** to the submission.

**Due Dates are normally set for Mondays and Wednesdays, 11:55 pm Pacific Time. The late submission period is the following Sunday! Late submissions without a prior granted extension by me will incur a 5% daily penalty off the grade during the late submission period. After that even late work will not be graded.** 

All deadlines in Canvas are based on Pacific Standard Time (PST). If you live in another time zone, remember to make the necessary adjustments in your planning.

Participation in the Q & A discussions each week can be helpful. This is a place to post questions as well as respond to others. If you respond to other student’s questions, you may receive extra credit for assisting. This gives you an opportunity to help others as well as learn in the process. That is the great part of an online discussion like this. We are a learning community.

Again posting questions about a assignment on the same day it is due will not give you enough time to get a helpful response.

```Also, I might not be able to respond to emails or "emergencies" on any given due date, so plan accordingly.```

## Emergency Extensions
If, however, life has conspired against you to prevent you from meeting an assignment deadline don't despair. I recognize that you may suffer from a sudden illness or other serious or significant event that is unforeseen and/or unpreventable and which adversely affects your ability to complete an assignment or assessment; in such cases you may request an extension for an assignment without penalty, but you must ask **more than one day** before the assignment is due. 

```Extension requests on the due date will not be considered!```

And all requests must have a legitimate reason and acceptable evidence! Evidence does not have to be submitted at the time of request, but it will be required **before** the final week of the semester in order for your grades to be adjusted correctly.   

###### Examples of legimate reason and acceptable evidence

|Reason| Evidence |
|--------|--------|
| Serious physical illness or accident resulting in hospitalization or medical emergency relating to yourself | Medical certificate/hospital report/report from qualified medical practitioner. These should be signed whilst the symptoms were still apparent to the medical practitioner. |
| Serious illness (as described above) or death of a member of your immediate family | A medical report from a qualified medical practitioner or a copy of a death certificate, coroner's report, letter from medical professional. Accompanied if necessary by formal documentation confirming relationship with the deceased.| 
|Severe adverse personal/family difficulties | Report from Student Counselling Service, Student Welfare Service or another qualified professional.|


###### Evidence that will not be accepted
*   Evidence not clearly linked to you or your close family member in question

*   Statements from friends, relatives or other associates stating whether you have been a victim of a crime
*   Anecdotal evidence without supporting documentary confirmation
*   Photographs or media extracts relating to events which are not accompanied by clear evidence of their relevance to the you or the assessment in question
*   Statements of support from other students unless accompanied by other documentation outlined in the list of acceptable evidence
*   Any evidence that is not clearly contemporaneous with the learning and teaching activities or assessment in question
