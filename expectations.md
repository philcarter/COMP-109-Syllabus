## How much time do I have to spend on this course?
The answer to this question depends on you. We all learn at a different pace, but on average, you should spend between five and six hours each week on the submissions. But at the beginning of the semester, I suggest planning for at least eight hours per week. Each week, you will submit three to four activities, with one to two due either Mondays or Thursdays. The two due days help you plan and keep you on pace. You may schedule your week differently, completing assignments earlier, something I would highly recommend.

## What can I expect from my instructor?
Staying connected is integral to this course. As your instructor, I’ll regularly communicate with you through Canvas announcements, messages, discussions, and assignment feedback throughout the term. I respond to Canvas messages and phone calls within 24 hours on weekdays (Monday–Friday, 9:00 AM–5:00 PM). You can expect feedback on assignments within 7 days after the due date, unless I let you know otherwise. To stay on track, please submit assignments by their posted deadlines, check Canvas often for updates, and actively participate in discussion boards by posting on time and responding to classmates as described in each module. These expectations are shared from the first day of class to help support your learning and success.

## Assignment Descriptions:

**Lesson** is created from existing Cengage textbook content. It is designed to promote chapter reading that introduces you to new skills and concepts. This assignment will take most of your time every week. The average is about 2 to 3 hours. (Plan 4 hours)  

**Project** measures students’ mastery of module learning objectives. Each project covers over 90% of the gradable module objectives. These projects will be the primary resource to prepare you for the two Capstone Projects. SAM Projects take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. (Plan 2 hours) 

**Capstone** projects measure students’ mastery of learning objectives across multiple modules. Each Capstone project covers vital skills across the group level of modules. They take approximately 50-75 minutes to complete; the time will vary by student and number of steps. SAM Capstone Projects are used as rigorous assessments for the test modules, each worth 10%. (Plan 2 hours)  

**Training** is an interactive training activity for each module.(Plan 1 hour)

**Quick Check** are session review questions taken from the textbook. The activity will require submitting five answers. They take about 20-30 minutes to complete; the time will vary by student. These questions are used to support the textbook material. (Plan 1 hour)

**Peer Review** are activities that allows students to review the Quick Check answers by other students. They take about 20-30 minutes to complete; the time will vary by student. (Plan 1 hour)

**Progress Review** is a check-in questionnaire. This allows you and your instructor to communicate your progress (Plan 1 hour)

## Test Schedule:
There is one midterm and one final exam. These are Capstone projects and are available for six days! Please check the Modules for Test 1 for the exact available and due dates! Test 2 - Capstone Project is due on the Monday of the Finals Week at 11:59 pm. There are no late submissions allowed for exams.

## Late Submissions
**Prepare properly and help avoid panic and penalties**

I prefer to accept submissions on time. Scheduling and submitting your work on time is essential in the workplace - you may lose your job if work is submitted late!

Now, I understand that everyone has the occasional problem and finishes their work late. Completing your assignments [even late] is very important for this course because the following modules, especially the final module, always build on what you have already learned.

So here is my compromise going forward:

**Due Dates are generally set for Mondays and Thursdays, 11:59 pm Pacific Time. The late submission period is six days! Late submissions without a prior granted extension by me will incur a 5% daily penalty off the grade during the late submission period.** After that, all late work will be marked 0.

Make sure you know when your assignments are due. Plan your work so that you can meet the submission deadlines. Consult your syllabus, ask in the module Discussion forums, or message me via inbox if you need clarification on an assignment/assessment deadline and submission procedures.

Give yourself as much time as possible to complete each assignment so you can complete it to the best of your ability, and you don't have to rush or worry about incurring late submission penalties. Avoid leaving completing an assignment to the last minute/hour/day just in case unexpected problems occur. I suggest having all your assignments done **at least one day prior** to the submission.
 
All deadlines in Canvas are based on Pacific Standard Time (PST). If you live in another time zone, remember to make the necessary adjustments in your planning.

Participation in the Q & A discussions each week can be helpful. Forums are the best place to post questions and respond to others. If you respond to other student’s questions, you may receive extra credit for assisting. This allows you to help others as well as learn in the process. That is the excellent part of an online discussion like this. We are a learning community.

Again, posting questions about an assignment on the same day it is due will not give you enough time to get a helpful response.

```Also, I might not be able to respond to emails or "emergencies" on any given due date, so plan accordingly.```

## Emergency Extensions
If life has conspired against you to prevent you from meeting an assignment deadline, don't despair. I recognize that you may suffer from a sudden illness or other serious or significant events that is unforeseen or unpreventable and which adversely affect your ability to complete an assignment or assessment; in such cases, you may request an extension for an assignment without penalty, but you must ask **more than one day** before the assignment is due. 

```Extension requests on the due date will not be considered!```

All requests must have a legitimate reason and acceptable evidence! Evidence does not have to be submitted at the time of the request, but it will be required **before** the final week of the semester for your grades to be adjusted correctly.   

###### Examples of legitimate reason and acceptable evidence

|Reason| Evidence |
|--------|--------|
| Serious physical illness or accident resulting in hospitalization or medical emergency relating to yourself | Medical certificate/hospital report/report from a qualified medical practitioner. These should be signed while the symptoms remain apparent to the medical practitioner. |
| Serious illness (as described above) or death of a member of your immediate family | A medical report from a qualified medical practitioner or a copy of a death certificate, coroner's report, or letter from a medical professional. Accompanied if necessary by formal documentation confirming relationship with the deceased.| 
|Severe adverse personal/family difficulties | Report from Student Counselling Service, Student Welfare Service, or another qualified professional.|


###### Evidence that will not be accepted
*   Evidence not clearly linked to you or your close family member in question

*   Photographs or media extracts relating to events that are not accompanied by clear evidence of their relevance to you or the assessment in question
*   Statements of support from other students unless accompanied by additional documentation outlined in the list of acceptable evidence
