## Using SAM 2019 (Training, Projects & Exams)
SAM** stands for **Skills Assessment Manager**. It is a digital resource and testing program for Microsoft Office, Windows, and computer concepts and also provides hands-on tutorial exercises as well as hands-on projects.

You will have links here in CANVAS to go into **SAM** and do the **SAM Training** and [required] **SAM Projects**. There will also be [optional] **SAM Practice Tests** that will help you do well on your exams.

Besides taking practice tests, you will also be taking all of your assessments in **SAM** via exams and capstone projects. That is why the training and practice tests in **SAM** will be so important, as they will allow you to get comfortable with the testing software and will help you study for the exams.

**SAM 2019** is designed not only to supplement your textbook but also serves as your primary “training partner” and examination manager.

If you have not received your SAM Printed Access Card yet, you can still complete Task 4\. Our publisher has given each of you a 14 day grace period for entering your key code. This means you can set up your SAM account and then have full access to all of SAM for 14 days. Each time you log into SAM, you'll be prompted for your key code and reminded of how many days are left in your grace period.

##### Step 2 

* [](http://embed.widencdn.net/pdf/plus/cengage/pqtboidv99/Enable_Browser_PopUps.pdf?u=c8lcjz)If you use a laptop computer to take the exam, be sure to use a mouse rather than a touchpad. SAM often misunderstands touchpad actions. If you are using a touch screen computer, you will want to use a mouse for your SAM exams.
* Always take practice tests when directed to in the course. These will help you prepare for your actual exams.
* Do not attempt to launch an actual exam until you are ready to take it and be graded on it. For security reasons, once you launch an exam, you must continue and you will be scored on your performance. **You cannot back out and start over and you cannot pause the exam if it is timed**.
* After taking a Practice Test, you may click on **REPORTS** in order to create a **Study Guide**. In the Guide, you are able to launch training for any Practice Test questions again that you wish. This option is NOT available for the real Exams. The Exam Study Guide will also direct you back to your textbook pages for the questions you may have gotten wrong.

##### Step 3 – Take the exam!
