> Having a questioning attitude; knowing what data are needed & developing questioning strategies to produce those data. Finding problems to solve.

—_Habits of Mind 7_

> The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. … To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advances.
