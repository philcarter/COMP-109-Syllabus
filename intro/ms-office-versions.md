Microsoft supports several versions of Office:

-  **Office 365:**<span> </span>A cloud-based subscription service that delivers Microsoft’s most up-to-date, feature-rich, modern productivity tools direct to your device. There are variations of Office 365 for business, educational, and personal use. Office 365 offers extra online storage and cloud-connected features, as well as updates with the latest features, fixes, and security updates.

-  **Office 2021:**<span> </span>Microsoft’s “on-premises” version of the Office apps, available for both PCs and Macs, offered as a static, one-time purchase and outside of the subscription model. **This is the recommended version to use for this course! **

-  **Office Online:**<span> </span>A free, simplified version of Office web applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote) that facilitates creating and editing files collaboratively.

Office 365 (the subscription model) and Office 2021 (the one-time purchase model) had only slight differences between them at the time this content was developed. Over time, Office 365’s cloud interface will continuously update, offering new application features and functions, while Office 2021 will remain static. Therefore, your onscreen experience may differ from what you see in this product. For example, the more advanced features and functionalities covered in this product may not be available in Office Online or may have updated from what you see in Office 2021.
