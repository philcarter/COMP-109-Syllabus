## [](#what-is-)What is "SAM Projects"?

SAM Projects allows you to create and submit files in Excel and get your files graded within minutes. As you learn the application, you'll be following this work pattern:

1.  Learn how to use features in the software by completing a "module project" in your Excel textbook. Submit the M01 project file in Canvas for grading.
2.  Now complete a similar file using SAM Project.

## [](#some-things-to-keep-in-mind-about-sam-projects:)Some things to keep in mind about SAM Projects:

Since all of your SAM Projects have deadlines, to find your SAM Projects from the Activities List, remember to uncheck the ALWAYS AVAILABLE button so that you can see assignments with deadlines (that are NOT always available).

You MUST start each project with the special SAM Projects "start file". This is explained in the video and in your instruction sheet (you'll probably want to print out this instruction sheet to make it easier to work with SAM Projects). And you MUST follow the directions closely when downloading, saving, and naming this file. If you make an error in ANY of these procedures, your file will either not be accepted or you will get a very poor grade on the assignment. AND you would need to start the assignment again from scratch. So pay close attention to this!

An important point when downloading the start file and then saving it to your computer is to change the number 1 at the end of the filename to the number 2\. In other words, if the filename of your start file is `SC_Excel2016_C1_P1a_PhilCarter_1` then you need to change it to **`SC_Excel2016_C1_P1a_PhilCarter_2`**. The easiest way to do this is to click to the right of the number 1 at the end of the filename when you are saving the file and backspace one time. Then type a 2\. Don't worry about the file extension .xslx as that is put into the file automatically by Excel. Depending upon your Excel settings, you may or may not see the file extensions when saving your files.

For each of your SAM Projects assignments, you will have the opportunity to see an error report, correct your errors and resubmit your files in SAM to improve your grade. You can submit each file a total of 3 times, as long as you do so by the deadline.

Your deadline for your SAM Projects will appear both in Canvas and SAM. Pay close attention to that deadline because no late submissions will be accepted. So, if you want to earn the full points, submit your files early so you have plenty of time to make corrections and resubmit.

After submitting your project into SAM, you may need to wait a few minutes to see your report. Don't panic if you don't see it right away. Take a short break and then try again. Watch the video to see how to navigate to the proper report. (HINT: click on REPORTS in the top menu in SAM. Then choose the link to REPORTS & FILES for the report you wish to see. You will then need to "open" the file to view it. ) Take a quick look at this to see how to access your SAM Projects REPORTS.

When you read your error report in SAM Projects, you won't be pointed directly to your errors. You'll be given a general idea of what type of error it is and approximately where the error is found. I guarantee that you will find this frustrating! But it's one of the things that I like best about SAM Projects. (I know, Iâ€™m strange.) You will be forced to proofread and find your own errors, with just some small hints about where to look. PLUS, if SAM says you have a particular type of error (a typo, for instance), you might indeed have more than one typo! And a typo could be a miss-typed word or something as small as an extra space. So, if you want to get the best grade possible, you'll need to brush up your proofreading skills!

And speaking of proofreading, SAM Projects wants you to space only one time following a period at the end of a sentence. That is the actually the "new" rule. Those of us who learned to type a while back learned to space two times after a period at the end of the sentence. But that is not the way things are done today. So the time has come to break that old habit!

When reading your SAM Report, you'll want to be sure you navigate to your "downloaded file". Open the file, look at the report which shows which steps you got wrong and the points taken off, then be sure you scroll down to the picture of the file you submitted. This will show you in more detail what you got wrong. But, when making corrections, be sure you open the original file you created. Correct the errors on THAT file and then resubmit. Don't make the corrections in the SAM Report.

You may NOT copy and paste from one file to another in SAM Projects. Because the start files are encoded in a special way, copying and pasting will mess with those codes. This will either result in an assignment being flagged to your instructor as "academic dishonesty" or in a huge number of errors in the assignment. So don't try it!

## [](#extra-info-about-sam-mxx-projects:)Extra info about SAM Projects:

In some of your SAM Project assignments, there are places in the instruction sheet you download from SAM where a bit of clarification is helpful. When those situations occur, look out for this "extra info" about the Projects.

In all of your SAM Projects, when you open the saved "start" file to begin work, the file may open in "protected view", depending upon the security settings on your computer. If this happens, you'll need to click ENABLE EDITING at the top of your screen to begin working with this file.
