> Goal-directed, self-imposed delay of gratification is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal, whether it be building a business, solving an algebraic equation, or pursuing the Stanley Cup.

## How are you doing?
Today, we begin with the material due for the 2nd week of the semester. The normal rhythms of an online course are in full swing. Before the end of this **week** you should have completed all of the Orientation activities. This coming Monday your first major **Excel** assignment is due. Don't forget! If you haven't started working through the assigned project in module 1, now is the time to get busy!

Have you got your bearings yet or do you still feel as if you are barely "treading water" in the attempt to get organized, in the effort to manage the class? There certainly is a lot to manage in an online course! It is easy to overlook details and deadlines. It is even easier to fall behind and never catch up.

###### May I encourage you to establish a daily check in routine.
Take the pledge now! Let no day pass without logging in at least once during the day. When you log in, what should you do? In brief, locate the current module (e.g. Module 1) and work your way through the reading assignments as soon as possible and quickly check the module discussion at least once a day. Doing this will help reduce the sense of surprise, the sense of feeling so overwhelmed with all the things to remember.

###### Tips for Success - Before You Begin the Next Assignment
- Textbook activities are due Mondays, and the SAM projects are due Wednesdays. You may complete the SAM Project the same day as your textbook project, but I would suggest to take a break between the two areas.  
- Be sure to **review the grading**  on the graded copy of your work. 
- Do this before you submit the module 2 assignments! You don't wan't to perpetuate careless errors that you missed in module 1.
- Based upon that grade, you will find patterns of mistakes that you will want to avoid before you submit your next assignments.
