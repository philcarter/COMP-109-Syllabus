**NOTE**: This being an introductory course has no bearing on the hours required to complete this course successfully. **This is a 4 unit class**. If you were taking this course in a "traditional" format, you would spend approximately four hours in class (textbook project and discussion), and eight hours doing coursework (assignments, SAM training, etc.). **Therefore, expect to spend 8 - 12 hours each week on this course!**


## Course Objectives
> “Start a beginner, end a power user.”

COMP 109 is an introductory course that presupposes no prior knowledge of Excel.

On completion of the course, you will have gone beyond beginning core skills to acquire intermediate and advanced skills as defined by the MCAS certification program.

With further review and practice you will be ready to sit for the Microsoft Certified Application Specialist certification (MCAS) for Excel 2019. This nationally recognized certification provides a way to demonstrate your expertise and qualifications to employers.

## Student Learning Outcomes
Upon successfully completing this class, a student will be able to accomplish the technical tasks listed below:

1.  Demonstrate the fundamentals of creating and managing worksheets and workbooks, creating cells and ranges, creating tables, applying formulas and functions and creating charts and objects.
2.  Enhance data presentation with lists, illustrations, charts, and other advanced formatting.
3.  Manipulate data by applying advanced formulas and data tools.
4.  Conduct data analysis using a range of Excel tools and techniques

## Online Format
From course orientation to assignment submission to test taking, this section is fully online.

There are NO on-campus meetings.

You must have the correct software installed and a correctly configured computer to take the class.

It is essential that you have Excel 2019 installed on your computer by the first day of class.

Although COMP 109 is designed for Excel beginners, you probably should feel somewhat comfortable with your computer prior to beginning the course.
