You may schedule a virtual office appointment with me at [Office Appointments](https://calendar.app.google/ndEXJp4hs9sLUPww7). My Office Hours are Mon - Thu, 11:30am - 12:00pm & 3:30 pm to 4:30pm. 
If that schedule does not work for you, send me a message via the Canvas Inbox, and setup a different timeslot. I respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday through Friday (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). 
You may also call my office number at (805) 892-3700, and I will answer if I am not in a meeting. Otherwise leave a voicemail and I will call you back within 24 hours.
