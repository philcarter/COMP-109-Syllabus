## Academic Integrity[^1]
Academic Integrity is a commitment to six fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage.

# Honesty
Honesty forms the indispensable foundation of integrity. Be honest with yourself and with each other.    

**Ways to demonstrate honesty:**

-   Be truthful
-   Give credit to the owner of the work (i.e., musician, author, artist, speaker etc.)
-   Keep promises
-   Provide factual evidence
-   Aspire to objectivity, consider all sides and one's own potential preconceptions
