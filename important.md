## Academic Integrity[^1]
Academic Integrity is a commitment to six fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage.

### Honesty
Honesty forms the indispensable foundation of integrity. Be honest with yourself and with each other.    

**Ways to demonstrate honesty:**

-   Be truthful
-   Give credit to the owner of the work (i.e., musician, author, artist, speaker etc.)
-   Keep promises
-   Provide factual evidence
-   Aspire to objectivity, consider all sides and one's own potential preconceptions

### Trust
You promote trust by preparing work that is honest, thoughtful, and genuine.

**Ways to demonstrate trust:**

-   Trust others
-   Give credence
-   Keep promises
-   Encourage mutual understanding
-   Act with genuineness

### Fairness
You engagne in fairness by doing your own original work, acknowledging borrowed work appropriately, respecting and upholding academic integrity policies, and by maintaining the good reputation of SBCC.

**Ways to demonstrate fairness:**

-   Engage with others equitably
-   Keep an open-mind
-   Be objective
-   Take responsibility for your own actions

### Respect
You show respect when you value and take advantage of opportunities to gain new knowledge by taking an active role in your own education, contributing to discussions, actively listening to other points of view, and performing to the best of your ability.

**Ways to demonstrate respect:**

-   Practice active listening
-   Receive feedback willingly
-   Accept that others’ thoughts and ideas have validity
-   Show empathy
-   Seek open communication
-   Affirm others and accept differences
-   Recognize the consequences of our words and actions on others

### Responsibility
You are responsible when you seek to obtain and understand information about classroom and institutional policy. You follow these policies and ask questions when you do not understand or disagree with them.

**Ways to demonstrate responsibility:**

-   Hold yourself accountable for your actions
-   Engage with others in difficult conversations, even when silence might be easier
-   Know and follow institutional rules and conduct codes. For more information, see the 
<a href="http://www.sbcc.edu/safety/standards_of_conduct.php" target="_blank">SBCC Student Code of Conduct</a> in the General College Catalog. 
-   Create, understand, and respect personal boundaries
-   Follow through with tasks and expectations
-   Model good behavior

### Courage
You exhibit courage when you hold yourself and your fellow learners to the highest standards of academic integrity even when doing so involves risk of negative consequences, such as a bad grade, or reprisal from their peers or others.

**Ways to demonstrate courage:**

-   Be brave even when others might not
-   Take a stand to address a wrongdoing and support others doing the same
-   Endure discomfort for something you believe in
-   Be undaunted in defending integrity
-   Be willing to take risk and risk failure
