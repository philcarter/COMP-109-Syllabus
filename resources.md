## System Requirements

### CANVAS:
###### Supported Browsers
For best performance, Canvas should be used on the current or first previous major release of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari. Because it's built using web standards, Canvas runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, or any other device with a modern web browser.

Canvas only requires an operating system that can run the latest compatible web browsers. Your computer operating system should be kept up to date with the latest recommended security updates and upgrades.

### SAM:
###### Supported Browsers

*   **Chrome** current and preceding version
*   **Firefox** current and preceding version
*   **Edge** current and preceding version (Windows only)

It is recommended that you should always use the most current version of your preferred browser. Your browser will notify you if there is a new version available.

###### Workstation Recommendations

*   Download bandwidth: 5+ Mbps
*   RAM: 2+ GB
*   CPU: 1.8+ GHz / multi-core
*   Display: 1366 × 768, color
*   Graphics: DirectX, 64+ MB
*   Sound (for some content)

>Note: No chromebooks or personal phones(ios/android)

#### Microsoft Excel

A fully **installed** Microsoft Excel version is required to complete online projects. Online projects do not work with the web based versions[^1] of Microsoft Excel. Office Online files have a different structure than files created on the desktop version of Office.

* Windows 10 or later: Microsoft Excel 2021 Home, Premium or University(this can be installed via Office 365) or Microsoft 365. Check your Office version: [About Office: What version of Office am I using?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)

SBCC Students have access to install Microsoft Office products via SBCC Pipeline for free. Please see the Business Computer Lab for help, or you also may schedule a zoom session with me.  

> macOS: This course does not officially support MS Excel with an Apple/Mac OS. Some project steps are different on Microsoft Excel for Mac. Instructions may include Mac accommodations for students, but features such as Power Query or Power Pivot are not available on Excel for Mac. SBCC Students who have an Apple computer, may also have access to a SBCC Virtual Desktop that has Microsoft Windows and MS Office 2021 installed or may install Windows 10 as an additional operating system on their computer. 

If you do not have the recommended operating system and office version, you should consider either using the Business Communication labs on SBCC main campus, or using our SBCC Virtual Desktop Infrastructure(VDI). Here are the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1duD0mKjnK5eJka20VJgY-DK_a2k3gigrPG4U546Ma2I/edit) for using VDI. 

[^1]: OFFICE 365 users: when you click on MS Excel, and a web browser opens up with Excel, you are in the web version. It will not work! Look in the upper right corner for the button to "Install Office" on your desktop/laptop.
