###### Cengage Unlimited

You will see many references to CENGAGE UNLIMITED (CU) when accessing SAM or the Cengage Website. CU is not required for this course and it is more expensive then the options listed above! But if you are enrolled in another course this semester that uses CENGAGE UNLIMITED, CU is a smart choice and you will not have to purchase above option 1 or 2 for this course. The materials required for this class—and any other classes using Cengage products—are included in ONE Cengage Unlimited subscription. For $119.99 per semester, you get access to ALL your Cengage eTextbooks and online homework in ONE place. Four FREE hardcopy textbook rentals are also available for select titles, just pay $7.99 S&H each.


## System Requirements

Canvas only requires an operating system that can run the latest compatible web browsers. Your computer operating system should be kept up to date with the latest recommended security updates and upgrades.

You should always use the most current version of your preferred browser. Your browser will notify you if there is a new version available.

Some project steps are different on Microsoft Excel for Mac and may include Mac Hints for students.SBCC Students who have an Apple computer, may also have access to a SBCC Virtual Desktop that has Microsoft Windows and MS Office 2019 installed or may install Windows 10 as an additional operating system on their computer. Please contact me, so I can forward your information to SBCC support to create an account for you.  
 
SBCC Students have access to install Microsoft Office products via SBCC Pipeline for free. Please see the Business Computer Lab for help, or you also may schedule a zoom session with me.  

[^1]: OFFICE 365 users: when you click on MS Excel, and a web browser opens up with Excel, you are in the web version. It will not work! Look in the upper right corner for the button to "Install Office" on your desktop/laptop.
