###### Cengage Unlimited
You will see many references to CENGAGE UNLIMITED (CU) when accessing SAM or the Cengage Website. CU is not required for this course and it is more expensive then the options listed above! But if you are enrolled in another course this semester that uses CENGAGE UNLIMITED, CU is a smart choice and you will not have to purchase above option 1 or 2 for this course. The materials required for this class—and any other classes using Cengage products—are included in ONE Cengage Unlimited subscription. For $119.99 per semester, you get access to ALL your Cengage eTextbooks and online homework in ONE place. Four FREE hardcopy textbook rentals are also available for select titles, just pay $7.99 S&H each.

## System Requirements

For best performance, Canvas should be used on the current or first previous major release of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari. Because it's built using web standards, Canvas runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, or any other device with a modern web browser.

Canvas only requires an operating system that can run the latest compatible web browsers. Your computer operating system should be kept up to date with the latest recommended security updates and upgrades.

###### Supported Browsers

*   **Firefox** 76 and 77 (Extended Releases are not supported)
*   **Edge** 81 and 83 (Windows only)
*   **Safari** 12 and 13 (Macintosh only)

You should always use the most current version of your preferred browser. Your browser will notify you if there is a new version available.
